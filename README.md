# Simple JavaScript Games

This repository contains two simple and fun JavaScript games: **Rock, Paper, Scissors** and **Dice Roll Challenge**.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors
A classic game where the player can choose **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**, and the computer randomly selects one. The game compares the two selections to determine a winner based on the following rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### Dice Roll Challenge
A fun game where you and the computer each roll a virtual dice, and the higher roll wins! If both rolls are equal, it's a tie.

### How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the JavaScript files (`rockPaperScissors.js`, `diceRollGame.js`) in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the file in Node.js using the following command:
   ```bash
   node [filename].js
